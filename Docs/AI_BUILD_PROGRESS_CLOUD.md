## P00 — Documentation foundation

- **Date:** 2026-10-31
- **Scope:** Replace every placeholder document under `Docs/` with content derived from `AI_BUILD_MASTER_PROMPT.md`.
- **Implementation summary / files changed:**
  - `Docs/AI_BUILD_PHASES.md` — full phase plan P00–P20 with owners, dependencies, deliverables and acceptance criteria.
  - `Docs/AI_BUILD_ARCHITECTURE.md` — module layout, data flow, services, threading, DI, storage, privacy, compatibility, testing architecture.
  - `Docs/GLOBAL_APP_STANDARDS.md` — Kotlin/architecture/Compose/a11y/logging/security/testing/build standards.
  - `Docs/TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md` — ADR-001…ADR-014, including the proposed rule precedence order (ADR-006).
  - `Docs/MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md` — device matrix + 11 checklist sections covering emulator and physical-device testing.
  - `Docs/CHANGELOG.md` — Keep-a-Changelog structure with `1.0.0` target and `Unreleased` section.
  - `Docs/AI_BUILD_PROGRESS_CLOUD.md` — this file.
- **Tests added:** none (documentation only).
- **Static review performed:** every requirement in the master prompt was cross-checked into the phase plan, an ADR or the manual checklist; placeholder-only documents eliminated; no product behaviour invented — precedence beyond the master prompt's explicit statements is recorded as *Proposed* in ADR-006 for confirmation.
- **API/compatibility considerations:** none in this phase (no code).
- **Known risks / unresolved questions:**
  - ADR-006 (rule precedence order) fixes user-visible skip reasons and should be confirmed by the user before P17 (Priority Announce) lands.
  - Module list in the architecture doc is the target state; modules are created incrementally per ADR-002.
- **Build status:** Not run (cloud-agent restriction).
- **Test execution status:** Not run (cloud-agent restriction).
- **Local verification:** Not locally verified.
- **Commit:** (recorded below after commit)
- **Next phase:** P01 — `:core:common` + `:core:rules` module foundation and eligibility rules (part 1).
